  Forest Guardians - Tower Defense
  Global Styles (index.css)

  The primary styling for the game is located inline within the <style>
  tags in index.html. This file can be used for any overarching styles
  or for styles that might be refactored out of the HTML in the future.

/*
  Example: Basic body reset, though the game's inline CSS already handles this.
  body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif; // Match game's default font
  }
*/

/*
  The game imports 'Nunito' font via @import in its inline <style> tag.
  If that were to be moved here, it would look like:
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap');
